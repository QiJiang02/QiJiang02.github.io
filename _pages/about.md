I am a GIS student, having graduated with a bachelor's degree in GIS from [the School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). I am about to continue my studies in Sweden and the Netherlands through the [Erasmus+ MSc in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation for Environmental Modelling and Management program](https://www.gem-msc.eu/). My research interests lie in Web GIS development and spatial data analysis.

You can find my CV here:[QiJiang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
